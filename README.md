# Havas Bros

A simple side-scrolling platformer inspired by classic 8-bit games. The project uses plain JavaScript and HTML with no external frameworks.

## Running
Open `index.html` in a modern browser to start playing.

Placeholder graphics are used for player, enemies, and blocks. To customize the player look, place the following files inside `assets/player`:
`player_idle.png`, `player_run1.png`, `player_run2.png`, `player_jump.png`, `player_crouch.png` and `player_dead.png`.
Place `coin_anim.png` in `assets/` for the question-block coins (6 frames at 32×32 each).
All images should be 64×64 pixels. The constant `SPRITE_SCALE` controls how large they appear when drawn (default 2×).
